## üîß Core Architecture (Cloud)

### 1. **Frontend**
| Component | Tech Stack |
|----------|------------|
| UI Framework | React (Next.js or similar) or Streamlit |
| Deployment | Vercel, Netlify, or Streamlit Community Cloud |
| Features | File upload, URL input, chat interface, error paste/debug, history (optional) |

### 2. **Backend API Layer**
| Component | Tech Stack |
|----------|------------|
| Framework | FastAPI (recommended), Flask, or LangServe |
| Responsibilities | Doc ingestion, vector embedding, query handling, LLM calls |
| Deployment | Docker + AWS EC2 / Google Cloud Run / Azure App Service |

### 3. **Document + Vector Storage**
| Type | Tool |
|------|------|
| Document Files | AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob |
| Vector Database | Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant (managed preferred) |
| Metadata DB | Postgres (e.g., for file ownership, access logs) |

### 4. **Authentication & Authorization**
| Use Case | Tools |
|----------|-------|
| User Login | Auth0, Firebase Auth, Clerk, or OAuth (Google, GitHub) |
| File Ownership | Associate documents with users in metadata store |
| Multi-Tenant Access | Per-user context isolation at vector DB + file system layers |

## ‚úÖ Key Features to Add

- [ ] User authentication
- [ ] Document tagging and ownership
- [ ] Per-user vector index isolation or namespacing
- [ ] Upload status and version control
- [ ] Asynchronous file processing (via background workers or queues)
- [ ] Prompt templates editable per org (optional)
- [ ] Usage tracking (for rate limiting or analytics)

## ‚öôÔ∏è DevOps + CI/CD

| Stage | Tools |
|-------|-------|
| Version Control | GitHub |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions, Railway, or Cloud Build |
| Containerization | Docker |
| Environment Config | `.env` + secret manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager) |

Example GitHub Actions workflow:
```yaml
name: Deploy Backend

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: docker build -t docs-assistant-backend .
      - run: docker push your-registry/docs-assistant-backend
